subtitle: "STEM Librarian | Data Science | Workingline GSDs"
description: "I first started out in organometallic chemistry because, let’s face it, liquid nitrogen is endlessly cool at any age. Later, I spent some time as an academic science and engineering librarian. My fascination with data science stems from my joy in vigorously shaking a dataset and watching the story fall out. You’ll also find me actively involved in the workingline German Shepherd Dog (GSD) community, which is reflected in some of my Projects. This all makes total sense once you meet me. 


Within my website, you’ll discover my writings about some fun personal projects I’ve worked on. You’ll also find links to presentations I’ve given. In my presentations, I always try to include a reflective element because I think it’s important to discuss the choices I’ve made.
